# Projects

1. **BBC News Articles Classification with Google's NNLM & Bayesian Optimization**
   - Developed a custom neural network architecture from scratch for BBC News Articles Classification.
   - Used **Google's NNLM** model for text embeddings.
   - Observed model behavior across various batch sizes, epochs, and learning rates
   - Optimized model hyperparameters with **bayesian optimizaiton**.
   - Highest Accuracy - **96.4%**

2. **Fine-tuning LLMs for Sentiment Analysis on SST-5**
   - Fine-tuned various language models like **DeBERTa, RoBERTa, ERNIE, DistilBERT, BERT, and GPT-2** for sentiment analysis on the SST-5 dataset.
   - Loaded the SST-5 dataset using the **datasets library**.
   - Tokenized all the examples in the dataset using corresponding tokenizer for the model.
   - Implemented Bayesian Optimization with **scikit-optimize**.
   - Due to computational resource limitations, I could only fully run optimization for DistilBERT and ERNIE.
   - Achieved the highest accuracy of **52.71%** with the optimized ERNIE model (highest-to-date: 59.8%)
